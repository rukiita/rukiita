## My Side Projects

[**_JS Rendering Engine Simulator_**](https://js-rendering-engine-lukiitas-projects.vercel.app/)

I developed a JS Rendering Engine Simulator to master the intricacies of web performance. By simulating the Critical Rendering Path, the Preload Scanner, and the lifecycle of JS parsing and execution, this application provides a systematic framework for understanding browser internals. It highlights exactly where and how JavaScript coding choices impact performance, turning abstract concepts into actionable engineering insights.

[**_Github Repository Explorer_**](https://github-repository-explorer-orcin.vercel.app/)

An application that was created over 5 days with the goal of validating technologies, confirming knowledge.

We specifically tested the manipulation and persistence of query parameters, along with the subsequent optimization of data caching. Furthermore, we verified three different data fetching and display patterns - CSR, SSR(Progressive Rendering), and Hybrid(SSR+CSR) - to explore methods for improving the User Experience (UX).

[**_Simple Crypto Dashboard_**](https://crypto-dashboard-seven-psi.vercel.app/)

This project was conceived as a "Level-Up Challenge" following a Todo App, completed within a strict 3-day deadline.

I confirmed implementations that are frequently used in production,Chart visualization, debouncing and suggestion functionality, pagination, and rate toggling.
Furthermore, I plan to utilize this project as a foundation to practice real-time data processing, leveraging the inherent characteristics of cryptocurrency data.

[***Basic Todo App***](https://github.com/rukiita/todo-app)

This Todo application is a project designed as a coding challenge within a 3-day deadline.

It was developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), with the goal of covering both test design and implementation.
